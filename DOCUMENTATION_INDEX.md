# 📋 ALPHADOME MULTI-TENANT DEPLOYMENT — COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION INDEX

**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Client:** Kassangas Music Shop (Gideon, +254702245555)  
**Status:** ✅ Documentation Complete, Ready for Implementation

## ✅ VERIFICATION: DATABASE STATE (Confirmed Feb 6, 2026)

### ✅ Gideon's Contact (Verified)
```
User ID:  823c3bcd-b66f-4010-9922-4a3b411226cc
Phone:    254702245555 (normalized from 0702245555)
Name:     Unknown User (can be updated)
Status:   Active - already interacted with bot (Oct 18 logs)
```

### ✅ Existing Schema Checked
- `public.users` — Gideon is here ✓
- `public.brands` — Default brand ID: 1af71403-b4c3-4eac-9aab-48ee2576a9bb ✓
- `public.conversations` — Logs all messages (single brand) ✓
- `public.subscriptions` — M-Pesa flow working ✓
- `alphadome.*` — Portfolio & business tables (non-conflicting) ✓

### ⚠️ Current Risk Identified
- Single WhatsApp token for all contacts
- Single OpenAI key for all contacts
- All logs tagged to DEFAULT_BRAND_ID
- **Solution:** New multi-tenant schema (4 tables, non-breaking)

## 🔑 KEY DECISIONS EXPLAINED

### Q: Why not separate Docker containers per client?
**A:** ❌ Expensive, complex, hard to maintain. One server with tenant-aware code is simpler.

### Q: Why not separate Supabase projects?
**A:** ❌ 100+ projects becomes unmaintainable. Single DB with RLS is the standard pattern.

### Q: Why add tables instead of modifying existing ones?
**A:** ✅ Non-breaking, backward compatible. Existing system still works if new code isn't deployed.

### Q: Can we add more clients without another deployment?
**A:** ✅ Yes! Just insert a row in `bot_tenants`, add templates & training data. Zero downtime.

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Will my current bot stop working?**  
A: No. The new code is backward compatible. Old system keeps running.

**Q: Can I roll back if something goes wrong?**  
A: Yes. Database changes are additive (no deletions). Code changes can be reverted.

**Q: What if Gideon's WhatsApp token expires?**  
A: We monitor expiry dates and alert 14 days in advance. Simple update in database.

**Q: Can Gideon manage his own bot via dashboard?**  
A: Yes, after Week 3. Dashboard allows template editing, FAQ management, etc.

**Q: What if we want to add a second client later?**  
A: Just insert a row in `bot_tenants`, add templates/training data. Done in 30 minutes.

**Q: Does this cost extra money?**  
A: No. Same hosting, same Supabase tier. Just more efficient code.
